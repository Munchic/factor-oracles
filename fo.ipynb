    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "Factor oracles are a deterministic finite-state automaton which can detect substrings (factors) of a given string. Finite-state automaton means that we can represent the algorithm of finding the substrings as a system of states, each with conditions for transitions to other states. A simple example could be a coin-vending machine, which has two states: awaiting for a bill and giving out coins. Awaiting for a bill has a transition condition of bill inserted that would move it to the second state. In the second state, inserting a bill would transition back to itself, whereas removing the coins would reset the machine into the awaiting state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a factor oracle, we put string indices as states and allocate one more for the initial state (0). The transitions are letters that the factor oracle receives. To simply put it, as we put in letters, we should arrive through a series of transitions at the right index of the substring occurance. Each state is connected with the consecutive state (since if two letters are neighbors in a string, they will form a substring). For each letter, we also find the letters that are next to it at any point later in the string. An example is $abacj$. In the automaton of factor oracles, $a$ will be connected with $b$ (as explained before), but it would also be connected with $c$, since if we query for $a$ and then $c$, we know that we're talking about the $a$ at position 2 (counting from 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor oracles are an exciting work-in-progress because it can be built incrementally in linear time and space complexity. Compared to older techniques for string matching, such as suffix trees, factor oracles are as efficient but require less memory and are easier to implement. Elaboration on oracle building time and space complexity will be provided in rubric 4 of Part II.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to note is that factor oracles are able to detect all of the string's factors (substrings) but it can also detect the ones that are not substrings, allowing room for false positives in certain applications. The index detected by factor oracle is also less or equal to the ending position of first occurance (again, related to the problem of falsely detecting substrings that are not there). Some of the examples will be shown in rubric 5 of Part II.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Implementation (factor oracle)\n",
    "#### 1. States in an oracle\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, states of an oracle are indices of a given string $p$. For each state, we need to be able to look up trasition conditions as well as add them. In the $OracleState$ class below, $supply\\_fn$ (supply function) is a function that maps state $i$ of the oracle to state $j$ where the first occurrence of $repet_p(i)$ (longest suffix of prefix $i$ of string $p$ that repeats at least twice in the prefix). It can be shown that supply function will always give a smaller value than $i$ (which is obvious because if a suffix appeared before, then the ending positing of the first occurrence of that factor will be before the last ending where the suffix is). We can note that for $OracleState.transitions$, we use a dictionary which is a hash map that will allow us $O(1)$ transition time and $O(1)$ space taken by each state (this will be proven in rubric 4)."

    "\n",
    "**Main operations**:\n",
    "1. $online\\_init()$ is a way to build a factor oracle \"online,\" which means to build in an incremental fashion as we receive new letters. In this case, this method takes in a string as a whole and feeds one character after another to $add\\_letter()$.\n",
    "2. $add\\_letter()$ takes in a new letter and builds a factor oracle from previous accumulated oracle an adding in the next character. It first connects the previous last state to the current last state since they are consecutive. Then, based on implications from Lemmas 9, 10 from Allauzen et al. (1999), we can go down the suffix path and for each of the states on the \"suffix path\" (a chain of supply functions starting from m, then $supply\\_fn(m)$, then $supply\\_fn(supply\\_fn(m))$ until when the value of is 0), connect them to the last inserted state with transition condition of the last inserted letter, since letters lying on the suffix path carry the same as the suffix of the whole string $p$. We know that any suffix of $p$ is connected to the newly inserted state; thus, the the factors lying on the suffix path (share the same suffix), will also be connected to the newly inserted state, as explained in Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper operations**:\n",
    "1. $traverse\\_oracle()$ simulates the work of the automaton by feeding it character-by-character and returning the last state the automaton stops at.\n",
    "2. $suff\\_repet()$ (not implemented) describes more details about $repet_p(i)$ mentioned in rubric 1.\n",
    "3. $first\\_occur()$ returns the ending position of the first occurrence of a substring in constant time with a chance of false positive, as mentioned in Introduction and will be demonstrated in rubric 5."

However, the time complexity is actually $O(1)$ because if it were scaling with $m$, we would be able to grab larger suffixes, proportionally to $m$, meaning that we would have an $O(m)/O(m)$ steps in the suffix path, which is $O(1)$.\n",
